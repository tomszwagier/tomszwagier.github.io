*The MVA (Mathematics, Vision, Learning) is a master of research at École Normale 
Supérieure Paris-Saclay. 
I followed it as part of a dual degree with Mines Paris during the year 2021-2022. 
As many people asked me about my experience during this year, I decided to make it available to everybody! This blog
post will be updated regularly with new content about the courses and the projects I chose.*
