I am a research intern in geometric statistics at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en) ( 
[Epione Team](https://team.inria.fr/epione/en/)), formerly dual-degree MSc student at
[Mines Paris - PSL](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu/) & [ENS Paris-Saclay (MVA)](https://www.master-mva.com/)), and
keenly interested in machine learning and eager to impact the statistical community with new ideas!

I recently started my Master's thesis at INRIA under the supervision of 
[Xavier Pennec](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Xavier.Pennec/ "Xavier Pennec Home Page"), funded by his ERC 2018
 Advanced Grant *"G-Statistics: Foundations of Geometric Statistics and Their Application in the Life Sciences"*.
The goal of this internship and the follow-up PhD is to explore, implement and study extensions and applications of
geometric dimensionality reduction methods from the new point of view of flag manifolds.

I am always glad to discuss my research or any topic related to applied mathematics, vision and machine learning, 
and open to any opportunity.
