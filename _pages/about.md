I am a PhD student in geometric statistics at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en) 
([Epione Team](https://team.inria.fr/epione/en/)), formerly dual-degree MSc student at
[Mines Paris - PSL](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu/) and [ENS Paris-Saclay (Master MVA)](https://www.master-mva.com/),
keenly interested in geometry, statistical learning and eager to impact the community with new
 ideas!

I started my PhD at Inria under the supervision of [Xavier Pennec](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Xavier.Pennec/) in
October 2022, funded by his [ERC 2018 Advanced Grant](https://gstats.inria.fr/) 
*"G-Statistics: Foundations of Geometric Statistics and Their Application in the Life Sciences"*.
The goal of the PhD is to explore, implement and study extensions and applications of
geometric dimensionality reduction methods from the new point of view of flag manifolds.

I am always glad to discuss my research or any topic related to applied mathematics, vision and machine learning, 
and open to any opportunity.
