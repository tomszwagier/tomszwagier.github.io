I am a PhD student in geometric statistics at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en) 
([Epione](https://team.inria.fr/epione/en/) project-team, 
[G-Statistics](https://gstats.inria.fr/) project), 
formerly dual-degree MSc student at [Mines Paris - PSL](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu/) 
and [École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay (Master MVA)](https://www.master-mva.com/),
keenly interested in differential geometry, statistics and optimization,
and eager to impact the machine learning community with new ideas!

I started my PhD at Inria under the supervision of [Xavier Pennec](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Xavier.Pennec/) in
October 2022, funded by his [ERC 2018 Advanced Grant](https://gstats.inria.fr/) 
*"G-Statistics: Foundations of Geometric Statistics and Their Application in the Life Sciences"*.
The PhD is entitled *"Rethinking statistical methods with flags spaces"* and aims to
study and extend dimensionality reduction methods from the new point of view of flag manifolds.

I am always glad to discuss my research or any topic related to applied mathematics, vision and machine learning, 
and open to any opportunity.

Please feel free to contact me: name[dot]surname[at]inria.fr
