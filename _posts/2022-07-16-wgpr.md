It all began with a Masterâ€™s project at MVA with [Xavier Pennec](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Xavier.Pennec/),
which enabled [Arthur Pignet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthurpignet/) and I to meet 
[Nina Miolane](https://www.ninamiolane.com/), who then encouraged us to submit it to ICLR 2022 Computational 
Geometry & Topology Challenge.

Our submission implements a method for nonlinear regression on Riemannian manifolds.
 
Although regression for datasets lying on Euclidean spaces is a well-established field, not many methods exist for data 
on Riemannian manifolds; they are either too simple like 
[Geodesic Regression (Fletcher IJCV 2013)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11263-012-0591-y) or they lack
interpretability. 

[Gaussian Process Regression](https://distill.pub/2019/visual-exploration-gaussian-processes/) 
is a well-known nonlinear regression method which incorporates 
prior knowledge about the data distribution in Euclidean spaces. The paper [Wrapped Gaussian Process Regression 
on Riemannian Manifolds (Mallasto & Feragen CVPR 2018)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8578683) generalizes
it to data lying on Riemannian manifolds using manifold-preserving tools, such as the ones implemented in 
[`geomstats`](https://github.com/geomstats/geomstats).
This submission proposes an implementation of the latter's Wrapped Gaussian Process Regression in `geomstats` 
and shows that it has many advantages over related Euclidean and geodesic models on synthetic examples
(toy data on a sphere) as well as real life ones (diffusion Tensor Imaging in the corpus callosum).

Here is a small illustration of our implementation in `geomstats` for data lying on a sphere. 
We compared it to Gaussian Processes, and we can clearly see that some of their predictions (in cyan) go out of the 
sphere, hence don't belong to the data space.
